Thinking:
```
The user is asking about improving the developer experience (DX) and has four
  specific questions:

  1. CLI testing of MCP tools instead of GUI inspector - they want to write unit
  tests
  2. Better documentation of development docker compose with step-by-step
  instructions
  3. Source maps for better stack traces in development mode
  4. General DX improvement ideas

  They explicitly said "Do not start any code implementations yet" so I should only
  analyze and answer their questions without making any code changes.

  Let me address each question:

  1. CLI testing of MCP tools: Yes, there are ways to test MCP tools from CLI. The
  MCP TypeScript SDK provides ways to run tools programmatically. You can create
  test scripts that import the server and call the tools directly, or use the MCP
  inspector in headless mode, or create a simple CLI wrapper script.
  2. Development docker compose: I should explain the current setup and provide
  clear step-by-step instructions. Looking at the current docker-compose.yml, I can
  see the services and explain how development mode would work.
  3. Source maps: Good point! The current build process in package.json probably
  doesn't include source maps. This would help with debugging runtime errors by
  showing original TypeScript line numbers instead of compiled JavaScript.
  4. Other DX improvements: I can suggest several improvements like:
    - Hot reload for development
    - Better logging and debugging
    - Pre-commit hooks
    - Better error messages
    - Development scripts
    - Testing framework setup
    - Environment variable validation
    - Health check endpoints
    - Performance monitoring
    - Documentation improvements

  Let me provide detailed answers to each question.
```

● Excellent questions about improving the developer experience! Let me analyze each
  one:

  1. CLI Testing for MCP Tools (Unit Testing)

  Yes, there are several ways to test MCP tools from CLI instead of the GUI
  inspector:

  Option A: Direct Tool Import & Testing
  # Create test scripts that import and call tools directly
  node -e "
  import('./dist/index.js').then(async (server) => {
    const result = await server.romanizeJapanese({text: 'こんにちは', scheme:
  'hepburn'});
    console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
  });
  "

  Option B: MCP Protocol Testing
  # Send MCP protocol messages via stdio
  echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"romanize_jap
  anese","arguments":{"text":"こんにちは"}}}' | node dist/index.js

  Option C: Test Framework Integration
  - Create Jest/Mocha tests that import tools directly
  - Mock the Ichiran client for faster unit tests
  - Integration tests that hit real Ichiran for accuracy

  2. Development Docker Compose Setup

  Current gaps I see:
  - No dedicated development compose file
  - No hot reload for TypeScript changes
  - No volume mounts for live code editing
  - No development-specific environment variables

  Should include:
  # docker-compose.dev.yml
  services:
    mcp-server-dev:
      build:
        context: .
        dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev  # New dev-specific Dockerfile
      volumes:
        - ./src:/app/src:ro  # Mount source for hot reload
        - ./dist:/app/dist   # Mount dist for build output
      environment:
        - NODE_ENV=development
        - DEBUG=mcp:*
      command: npm run dev  # Hot reload command

  3. Source Maps for Better Stack Traces

  Current build process issues:
  - TypeScript compilation likely doesn't generate source maps
  - No source map support in runtime
  - Stack traces show compiled JS instead of original TS

  Need to add:
  - Source map generation in build process
  - Source map support in development mode
  - Better error handling with original file/line info

  4. Additional DX Improvement Ideas

  Development Workflow:
  - Hot reload - Automatic restart on TypeScript changes
  - Watch mode - Continuous compilation during development
  - Development logging - Verbose debug output with request/response details
  - Environment validation - Check required env vars on startup

  Testing & Quality:
  - Unit test framework - Jest setup with TypeScript support
  - Integration tests - End-to-end MCP protocol testing
  - Mock mode - Fake Ichiran responses for faster testing
  - Performance benchmarks - Track response times and memory usage

  Developer Tools:
  - CLI helper scripts - Easy commands for common tasks
  - Health dashboard - Web interface showing service status
  - Request logging - Save/replay tool requests for debugging
  - Error reproduction - Capture failed requests for investigation

  Code Quality:
  - Pre-commit hooks - Lint/format before commits
  - Type checking - Strict TypeScript configuration
  - Code coverage - Track test coverage metrics
  - Documentation generation - Auto-generate API docs

  Configuration & Setup:
  - Environment templates - .env.example with all variables
  - Setup validation - Script to check prerequisites
  - Quick start scripts - One-command setup for new developers
  - Troubleshooting guides - Common issues and solutions

  Monitoring & Debugging:
  - Request tracing - Follow requests through the system
  - Performance profiling - Identify bottlenecks
  - Memory leak detection - Monitor resource usage
  - Circuit breaker dashboard - Visualize service health

  Would you like me to prioritize these improvements and start implementing them?
  I'd suggest starting with:

  1. Source maps + hot reload (immediate development comfort)
  2. CLI testing framework (enables proper unit testing)
  3. Development docker compose (streamlines setup)
  4. Better logging & debugging (easier troubleshooting)
