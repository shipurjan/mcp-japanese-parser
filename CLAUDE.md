# MCP Japanese Parser

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

**Mission**: Provide AI assistants with superior Japanese text analysis capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling better Japanese language learning and development workflows.

**Current Status**: **Core MVP implemented** with functional tools, but not yet production-ready. Integration, packaging, and real-world testing still needed.

## What This Project Achieves

### Core Value Proposition

Unlike basic tokenizers or MeCab alternatives, this MCP server delivers:

- **Superior Japanese text segmentation** that handles complex grammar patterns, contractions, and modern language usage
- **Rich linguistic analysis** with part-of-speech tagging, grammatical information, and morphological breakdown
- **Comprehensive dictionary integration** providing detailed word definitions, usage examples, and frequency data
- **Multiple romanization schemes** including Hepburn, Kunrei-shiki, and specialized variants
- **Structured JSON output** optimized for AI assistant integration
- **Production-ready reliability** with comprehensive error handling and monitoring

### Target Impact

**For Japanese Language Learners:**

- AI assistants can provide accurate text breakdowns and explanations
- Complex sentences become understandable through proper segmentation
- Learning materials can be automatically analyzed for difficulty assessment

**For Developers:**

- Japanese text processing in AI applications becomes straightforward
- Translation workflows gain linguistic context for better accuracy
- Development tools can provide intelligent Japanese text assistance

**For Educational Use:**

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Core Infrastructure

- **MCP Server Framework**: Functional server with four operational tools
- **Ichiran Integration**: Docker-based integration with comprehensive CLI access
- **Error Handling**: Circuit breakers, rate limiting, timeout management
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript, testing framework, professional development workflow

### ðŸ”§ Tools Implemented But Not User-Tested

- **Text Parsing**: Japanese text segmentation with dictionary information
- **Romanization**: Multiple scheme support (hepburn, kunrei, passport)
- **Kanji Analysis**: Character-level information and readings
- **Health Monitoring**: Service status and performance metrics

### ðŸš§ Missing for Production Readiness

- **Real LLM Integration**: Not yet tested with Claude Desktop or other MCP clients
- **Installation Package**: No published npm package or easy installation method
- **User Documentation**: Missing setup guides and usage examples
- **End-to-End Testing**: No validation with actual AI assistant workflows
- **Distribution Strategy**: No clear path for users to install and configure
